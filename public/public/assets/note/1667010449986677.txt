Input : physical mesaurments
Output : Age


Confusion matrix :

it is a performance measurement for machine learning classification problem where output can be two or more classes. It is a table with 4 different combinations of predicted and actual values.




True Positive: we predicted something positive and it’s true.

True Positive: we predicted something negative and it’s true.

False Positive: we predicted positive and it’s false

False Negative: You predicted negative and it’s false.



ROC Graph : A Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical plot used to show the diagnostic ability of binary classifiers

ROC
Graph stands for ‘Receiver Operating Characteristics Graph

The points (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) and (0, 0)

(0, 1) : The Perfect Classifier ... TPR= P/P = 1 
FPR = 0/N =0

(1,0): The Worst Possible Classifier : TP Rate (Recall) = 0/P = 0 and FP Rate = N/N = 1

(1,1)The Ultra-liberal Classifier : This classifier always predicts the positive class. The True Positive rate is
1 but the False Positive rate is also 1. The False Negative and True Negative
rates are both zero

(0,0):The Ultra-conservative Classifier
This classifier always predicts the negative class. The False Positive rate is
zero, but so is the True Positive rate
